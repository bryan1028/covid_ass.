# 📊 COVID-19 Case Trend Analysis

## 🌐 Project Description
A Python-based analysis of COVID-19 case trajectories across multiple countries, comparing progression patterns from 2020-2024. This project demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, and time-series analysis using real-world pandemic data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare case growth patterns in 4 nations
- Demonstrate pandas/Matplotlib proficiency
- Generate publication-ready visualizations
- Extract meaningful public health insights

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
```bash
Core Stack:
- Python 3.9+
- pandas (data wrangling)
- Matplotlib (visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (interactive analysis)

Supporting Libraries:
- NumPy (numerical operations)
- datetime (time handling)
```

## 🚀 Running the Project
### Option A: Jupyter Notebook
```bash
1. Install requirements: pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib
2. Launch notebook: jupyter notebook COVID19_Analysis.ipynb
3. Run all cells (Kernel > Restart & Run All)
```

### Option B: Script Version
```bash
1. Install pandas/matplotlib: pip install pandas matplotlib
2. Run analysis: python covid_analysis.py
3. View results: open covid_results.png
```

## 🔍 Key Insights
1. **Diverging Trajectories**: 
   - United States showed exponential growth
   - Kenya maintained relatively flat curve

2. **Data Quality Notes**:
   - European nations had more consistent reporting
   - Developing nations showed periodic reporting gaps

3. **Visual Findings**:
   - Clear "waves" visible in all countries
   - 2021 Delta variant spike most pronounced in India
